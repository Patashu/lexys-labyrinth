# Lexy's Labyrinth

This is a web implementation of a puzzle game that bears a _striking_ similarity to [Chip's Challenge](https://wiki.bitbusters.club/Chip%27s_Challenge) and its [sequel](https://wiki.bitbusters.club/Chip%27s_Challenge_2), but is legally distinct, and also free!

Documentation is underway on the [wiki](https://github.com/eevee/lexys-labyrinth/wiki).
