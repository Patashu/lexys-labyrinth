# Lexy's Labyrinth

This is a web implementation of a puzzle game that bears a _striking_ similarity to [Chip's Challenge](https://wiki.bitbusters.club/Chip%27s_Challenge) and its [sequel](https://wiki.bitbusters.club/Chip%27s_Challenge_2), but is legally distinct, and also free!

It is a work in progress and also might be abandoned and forgotten at any time.
